# GLSL Live Wallpaper Shaders
A selection of live wallpaper shaders for [Shader Editor](https://github.com/markusfisch/ShaderEditor) (Android).

I created these shaders for fun in my spare time on my phone - please excuse formatting and short variable names.
Using Shader Editor these shaders can be used as live wallpapers. Most of them feature touch interactivity.

## How to use a shader as live wallpaper
* Download a shader (GLSL-File) from the repository.
* Copy the shader to your phone into a folder called "ShaderEditor" in the "Download"-Directory.
* Install Shader Editor ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.markusfisch.android.shadereditor), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.markusfisch.android.shadereditor/))
* Open the settings, scroll to the bottom and choose "Import shaders" (currently in beta)
* Exit the settings and verify the shader is loaded and working
* Choose the shader for live wallpaper in the settings
